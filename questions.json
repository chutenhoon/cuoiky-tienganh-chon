      "passage": "The increase in urbanization causes different problems. Air and water pollution are amongst the major issues we have to tackle.\nIn the first page, cars, factories, and burning waste emit dangerous gases that change the air quality in our cities and pose threats to our health. Dangerous gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides cause respiratory diseases, for instance, bronchitis and asthma. These are also proven to have long-term effects on the environment.\nFurthermore, with the increased population, it becomes difficult to manage the waste generated in cities. Most of the waste is discharged or dumped into rivers or onto streets. The waste pollutes water and makes it unfit for human consumption. Subsequently, it becomes more and more difficult for city dwellers to get clean water. Some cities in Africa are unable to provide adequate water supply because most of the water is lost in pipe leakages. In fact, most city dwellers in developing countries are forced to boil their water or to buy bottled water, which is very expensive.\nThere are several actions that could be taken to eradicate the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be joining community efforts to address problems affecting your city. Ask your parents, friends, and relatives to join in as well. These efforts might include clean-up campaigns, recycling projects, and a signature campaign to ask the government to do something about these problems and to discuss how young people can help to solve them.",

      "passage": "Pollution and Its Global Impact\n[I] Pollution is one of the most pressing issues in the modern world, affecting not only the environment but also public health and global economies. [II] While urbanization and industrialization have brought significant progress, they have also introduced severe environmental challenges. [III] Reducing pollution requires a comprehensive approach that includes public awareness, technological innovation, and stricter environmental policies. [IV]\nAir pollution is among the most widespread forms of environmental degradation. It stems from emissions by vehicles, factories, and deforestation, leading to harmful effects on both human health and the climate. According to the United Nations, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) causes millions of premature deaths annually. Water pollution, caused by untreated waste, agricultural runoff, and oil spills, destroys marine ecosystems and threatens human water supplies. Similarly, soil pollution—often overlooked—results from pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial waste, severely impacting agriculture and biodiversity.\nWhile governments worldwide have implemented measures to combat pollution, individual action is equally essential. Reducing plastic consumption, opting for sustainable transportation, and recycling waste can significantly lessen environmental harm. Moreover, industries must adopt cleaner production methods, such as renewable energy and green technology. However, these solutions are effective only when paired with robust educational campaigns that encourage people to understand and address pollution’s consequences.\nDespite these efforts, the problem persists, especially in developing nations, where economic constraints hinder environmental policies and waste management systems. At the same time, wealthier countries often export waste to poorer regions, exacerbating the issue. Experts stress that international cooperation is essential to tackle pollution on a global scale. Unless all nations contribute, the planet’s resources and ecosystems may face irreversible damage.",

      "passage": "The overall level of urbanization in Indonesia is low in relation to other countries that are at a comparable stage of economic growth. This can be explained by the phenomenon of nonpermanent, or “circular,” migration on Java and elsewhere: individuals from rural areas live and work in the cities, but they return to their homes at least once every six months. Nevertheless, although there is regional variation in urban growth rates, cities of every population size are growing rapidly.\nThe growth of the cities has not been accompanied by a parallel growth of industry. The outlook of much of the urban population is still rural. For example, large parts of the population, even in Jakarta, live in settlements that amount to urban kampongs (villages), maintaining rural customs. Urban dwellers generally have a higher standard of living than their rural counterparts, but the availability of adequate housing, potable water, and public transportation services has remained a critical concern.\nIndonesia’s urban areas also display great social and economic diversity. The upper class consists of government officials, military officers, and business leaders with a Western orientation; the growing middle class includes civil servants, teachers, and other professionals, as well as skilled workers who typically must struggle to maintain their economic position; and the lower class comprises a larger number of minimally educated and unskilled laborers, traders, and other members of the informal economy who strongly identify with their villages and frequently move back and forth to engage in economic pursuits in both areas.\nThe significant rural migration rate in main cities makes them ethnically diverse. Jakarta is the most diverse. Many individuals born or raised there still refer to themselves as Batak, Javanese, or Minangkabau and use their local languages at home. These ethnic ties often are strengthened by trips to home villages during harvest time or Ramadan month.",

      "passage": "[I] Green living, often referred to as sustainable living, encourages individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices in their daily lives. [II] This lifestyle includes reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and promoting eco-friendly habits, which collectively help to minimize the negative impact on the environment (Davies & Mulligan, 2017). [III] Although green living requires effort and adjustment, its benefits for the planet and future generations are substantial. [IV]\nOne of the fundamental aspects of green living is waste reduction. This can be achieved through practices like recycling, composting, and reducing single-use plastics. According to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recycling and composting can significantly decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills, which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution (EPA, 2021). Additionally, adopting reusable items such as water bottles and shopping bags minimizes reliance on plastic, which is crucial for protecting ecosystems and wildlife.\nAnother key component of green living is energy conservation. Simple changes, like switching to LED light bulbs and using public transportation, can reduce an individual's carbon footprint. A study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that energy efficiency improvements, if widely implemented, could decrease global energy demand by up to 40% by 2050 (IEA, 2019). By conserving energy, individuals not only lower their utility bills but also contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions, which is essential for mitigating climate change.\nGreen living also involves making conscious choices about the products we consume. This includes opting for sustainably sourced goods, supporting local businesses, and choosing organic produce. Sustainable agriculture practices reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers, which can harm both the soil and water sources (Smith & Taylor, 2020). By making informed purchases, consumers can support eco-friendly industries and help create a demand for greener alternatives.\n(Adapted from The Impact of Green Living by Davies, Mulligan, and others)",

      "passage": "In an increasingly competitive job market, the debate between work experience and academic qualifications remains a crucial topic among job seekers and employers. A recent survey by a US professional association - the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) showed that 83% of employers consider relevant work experience to be a critical factor when hiring new graduates. This statistic underscores the growing importance of practical skills and real-world application of knowledge in today's economy.\nWhile academic qualifications provide a foundational understanding of theories and concepts, they often lack the experiential component that prepares students for the workforce. According to a 2023 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals with work experience, such as internships or part-time jobs related to their field, are 30% more likely to secure employment post-graduation compared to their peers who rely solely on academic credentials. This trend emphasises the need for students to engage in real-life experiences during their studies.\nEmployers are increasingly seeking candidates who can demonstrate not just what they know, but how they can apply that knowledge effectively in diverse situations. Many educational institutions are taking note, with 63% now incorporating internships as a mandatory part of their curriculum, according to a recent study by CareerBuilder.\nThe ideal candidate often embodies a blend of both academic knowledge and hands-on experience. As the landscape of employment evolves, it is evident that possessing both skill sets can significantly enhance a graduate's chances of successful employment in various fields. Balancing work experience and academic qualifications may well be the key to navigating this complex professional terrain and achieving long-term career success.",

But some students have great ideas that simply cannot wait until graduation day. With many free resources and technologies available to them, more and more university students are finding ways to start small businesses while they are still in school.\nGreen Mobile: As a student at the University of Missouri, Brian Laoruangroch used to sell refurbished cell phones on eBay as a hobby. But when Brian realized how much money he could make by buying, fixing, and reselling phones, he decided to create his own website to resell the phones. His parents loaned him money, and he received money from his local government to found a company called Green Mobile, which now has local retail stores and about 20 employees. Brian said balancing work and studies was tough, but he didn't forget to pay attention in class.\nWhitney Williams Collection: Whitney Williams has always been creative, and she enjoys making things in her spare time. While in elementary school, she sold handmade stationery to people in her neighborhood, and later she expanded her offerings to include one-of-a-kind purses. When Whitney visited Italy as a student at Texas Christian University, the handmade jewelry there inspired her to start her own jewelry business. Instead of partying with friends or traveling, Whitney spent most of her weekends for the next two years selling her high-quality jewelry at small shows and private sales. As a result, the Whitney Williams Collection is now produced and sold around the world. Whitney hopes to eventually expand her brand to include shoes, clothing, and accessories.\nPunch: As a competitive swimmer, Zac Workman became very familiar with energy drinks. [I]. However, Zac found problems with most energy drinks. [II]. They either tasted bad, used chemicals that weren't healthy, or made the user feel tired again when its sugary energy was used up. [III]. Using an old family recipe for fruit punch, Zac developed an energy drink with natural ingredients, and found a partner to produce it.

      "passage": "Cultural diversity is like having a big mix of different cultures all living together in one place. It's not just about different traditions and languages; it's about the unique ways people live their lives. This mix is crucial for creating a friendly and connected world, where everyone's uniqueness is not just accepted but also celebrated.\nOne of the most interesting things about cultural diversity is that it allows us to share and exchange ideas. When people from different cultures meet, it's like a cultural exchange programme happening naturally. We get to learn from each other, understand different perspectives, and appreciate the varied combination of human experiences. This mutual learning helps us realise that even though we may be from different backgrounds, we share more similarities than differences.\nCultural diversity isn't just about the present, it's also about the preservation of the past. Every culture has its own special story, a history that goes way back, and things they always do like traditions. When we celebrate cultural diversity, we're not just acknowledging where people come from, we're recognising the wealth of knowledge and wisdom that has been passed down through generations.\nMoreover, this mix of cultures makes our world interesting and more creative. [I] When people from different backgrounds work together, they bring unique insights and approaches. [II] This variety of new ideas and creative solutions allows society to develop in different areas, from technology and science to art and entertainment. [III] To maintain that, we must make an effort to actively include everyone. Being inclusive means making sure everyone feels welcome, regardless of where they're from or what language they speak. Schools, workplaces, and communities all play a role in connecting. [IV]\nIn conclusion, cultural diversity is not just a fancy term, it's about appreciating and celebrating the richness of human differences. By embracing our diversity, we create a world where everyone belongs, where our unique cultures are valued, and where the collective human experience becomes even more beautiful.",

      "passage": "Urbanization refers to the process through which cities grow and expand as more people move from rural to urban areas. This phenomenon is driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, educational facilities, and healthcare services, which often attract individuals seeking better living standards. As cities become more populated, they undergo significant transformations in infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and public services.\nThe rise in urban populations can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. On the positive side, urbanization can stimulate economic development, innovation, and cultural exchange. It often brings improvements in living standards and provides better access to services and amenities. However, rapid urban growth can also strain existing infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and inadequate public services. These challenges can impact the quality of life in urban areas and require careful planning and management.\nEffective urban planning is crucial to mitigating the negative effects of urbanization. This includes creating sustainable infrastructure, managing resources efficiently, and ensuring equitable access to services for all residents. By addressing these challenges, cities can harness the benefits of urbanization while improving the overall quality of urban life.",

With rising temperatures and increasing sea levels, the impact of climate change is already being felt around the globe. (II) This makes it clear that immediate action is necessary to prevent further damage. (III) Educating students about the environment and climate change is more important than ever, especially when some people, such as oil and gas representatives in Austin, are trying to prevent climate change from being taught in schools. (IV)\nA recent study by The Lancet shows that 70% of young people between the ages of 16 and 25 are \" very or extremely worried\" about climate change. This concern, known as \"climate anxiety,\" highlights the need to provide students with both knowledge and practical solutions. By teaching students about climate change and what they can do to help, educators can give young people the tools they need to make a positive difference, even if their actions may seem small at first.\nDespite having easy access to information, many students struggle with misinformation online. This is why it is so important to teach students how to tell the difference between true and false information. Teachers can help students understand the real state of the planet by providing them with accurate facts and evidence. By doing so, educators can help students see the bigger picture while also giving them hope by showing them that there are actions they can take to help protect the environment.\nAs climate anxiety grows, it is essential that teachers provide clear, actionable steps for students to become more involved in protecting the environment. By focusing on practical solutions and encouraging climate-conscious behavior, educators can help prepare students to take on the challenge of climate change and make a positive impact on the world.",
